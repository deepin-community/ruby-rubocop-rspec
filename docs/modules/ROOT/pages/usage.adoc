= Usage

You need to tell RuboCop to load the RSpec extension. There are three
ways to do this:

== RuboCop configuration file

Put this into your `.rubocop.yml`.

----
require: rubocop-rspec
----

Now you can run `rubocop` and it will automatically load the RuboCop RSpec
cops together with the standard cops.

== Command line

[source,bash]
----
$ rubocop --require rubocop-rspec
----

== Rake task

[source,ruby]
----
RuboCop::RakeTask.new do |task|
  task.requires << 'rubocop-rspec'
end
----

== Code Climate

`rubocop-rspec` is available on Code Climate as part of the rubocop engine. https://codeclimate.com/changelog/55a433bbe30ba00852000fac[Learn More].

== Inspecting files that don't end with `_spec.rb`

By default, `rubocop-rspec` only inspects code within paths ending in `_spec.rb` or including `spec/`. You can override this setting in your config file by specifying one or more patterns:

[source,yaml]
----
# Inspect all files
AllCops:
  RSpec:
    Patterns:
    - '.+'
----


[source,yaml]
----
# Inspect only files ending with `_test.rb`
AllCops:
  RSpec:
    Patterns:
    - '_test.rb$'
----
